# TrackerPosition
OPENVR Steam Position Tracking in Python that retreives X Y and Z position and rotation

Open the project in VSCode or some python IDE, while running SteamVR.

Install requirements...
```angular2html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Afterwards, open main.py and modify settings to how you see fit, then run main.py with
```angular2html
python main.py
```
When you are done recording, press [Enter] in the command line to automatically save and/or replay what was recorded.

This can track the VR headset, base stations, controllers, and trackers. Modify however you see fit, I don't care lol.
